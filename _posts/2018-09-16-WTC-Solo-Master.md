title: WTC Master Solo report, 4th
---

While I was disappointed to not be in a WTC team, being here to support the french team was a treat, and there is a cool side tournament in solo to keep oneself occupied. Since thoses days I mostly train Exalted, to be prepared once CID drop, I feared to be underprepared. Turn out, I was just fine.

My list
=======

As regular readers might expect, I have come with Morghoul 2 and Zaadesh 2

The Morghoul list have been tweaked that way :

[Theme] Masters of War

* (Morghoul 2) Lord Assassin Morghoul [+29]
    - Archidon [10]
    - Archidon [10]
    - Titan Gladiator [15]
    - Aptimus Marketh [5]
* Extoller Soulward [3]
* Extoller Soulward [3]
* Mortitheurge Willbreaker [4]
* Paingiver Beast Handlers (min) [5]
* Praetorian Ferox (min) [12]
* Praetorian Ferox (max) [20]
* Praetorian Swordsmen (max) [13]
    - Praetorian Swordsman Officer & Standard [4]
* Tyrant Commander & Standard Bearer [0(6)]
* Tyrant Commander & Standard Bearer [0(6)]

The swordmen have come in to make sure I have enough unit point when the change of Master of War will roll out (and the dragoon would not count anymore).

Zaadesh 2 is its usual self :

[Theme] Imperial Warhost

* (Zaadesh 2) Lord Tyrant Zaadesh [+28]
    - Agonizer [0(6)]
    - Agonizer [0(6)]
    - Archidon [10]
    - Basilisk Krea [0(7)]
    - Desert Hydra [38]
    - Rhinodon [12]
    - Titan Gladiator [15]
    - Titan Sentry [15]
* Orin Midwinter, Rogue Inquisitor [5]
* Paingiver Beast Handlers (max) [7]

I am seriously considering the Gobber River Raider for more solos. The lack of unit isn't too important, but the lack of solo really hurt. On the other hand, Orin is so scandalously good ...

Drudge Match vs Germany - Zaadesh 2 vs Gunnbjorn - Recon 2
==========================================================

I was there when our captain asked if I was up to a drudge. Alway here to help ! 

He had Kolgrimma and Gunnbjorn. I expect Kolgrimma and take Zaadesh ; he drop Gunnbjorn, a somewhat odds choice when facing armor 23.

[Theme] Storm of the North

* (Gunnbjorn 1) Captain Gunnbjorn [+28]
    - Glacier King [35]
    - Trollkin Runebearer [0(5)]
* Bog Trog Mist Speaker [4]
* Fell Caller Hero [0(5)]
* Krielstone Bearer & Stone Scribes (min) [6]
    - Stone Scribe Elder [3]
* Northkin Bear Handlers & Battle Bears [10]
* Northkin Bear Handlers & Battle Bears [10]
* Northkin Fire Eaters [7]
* Pyg Lookouts (max) [10]
* Swamp Gobber Bellows Crew [2]
* Trollkin Champions (max) [16]
    - Skaldi Bonehammer [0(5)]


Zaadesh 2 vs Gunnbjorn, 2x rectangular zone and 2x flag, loss

On the right side, the hydra make a starring contest with the glacier king and win it while snacking on bear, making it flee to the other side. On the other side, I dispatch the champions and lookout quickly, but I get fire eaters and bear in my deployement zone, and need to send two heavies to deal with them. He use them to get 3 scenario points, both by me still being too shy with the hydra and having few model in the other zone. I give up after the last two champions tough three time in a row, because it seemed suitably epic to me :)

I think the match up is at my advantage, since he don't really get to hit hard enough, but scenario is a real weakness, especially on recon 2 where I alway fear to risk my only solo on the flag.

Solo Master, round 1 - Morghoul 2 vs Skarre 1 - Mirage
======================================================

My opponent was traumatized by a skorne player of her playclub, so she dreaded the match. With good reasons. I don't remember the other list apart from "it's even better if she choose it".

[Theme] Dark Host

* (Skarre 1) Pirate Queen Skarre [+28]
    - Stalker [8]
    - Stalker [8]
    - Stalker [8]
    - Stalker [8]
    - Skarlock Thrall [0(4)]
* Bane Lord Tartarus [0(6)]
* Machine Wraith [2]
* Machine Wraith [2]
* Scrap Thrall (3) [2]
* Bane Riders (max) [20]
* Bane Riders (max) [20]
* Bane Warriors (min) [10]
 - Bane Warrior Officer & Standard [0(5)]
* Wraith Engine [15]

An odd list, but mostly better than the classic one against me, because I really don't like thoses bane riders, while I can deal with the BEs. I get the first turn thank to that super sweet +1 to start. She take the side with a wall. I take that as a secret sign that she want Walles to win the WTC. She's a red head, so it all make sense ! (note : she is german).

*Turn 1* : I make Morghoul charge at 13.1 of the two central stalkers, while the ferox riders put themselves at 13.1" of the . She have two stalkers run away in fear, put two behind the house with a BE next to him. The riders advance boldy, as expected.

*Turn 2* : Marketh Mortalize the wraith Engine. A tyrant commander Push the Limit of Morghoul, who move 9" to get to one stalker and the BE, feat on the two stalker behind the house, the BE, and 8 riders (one of each unit is behind the other), and about half the bane warriors. He then kill both the Engine and the stalker he can reach, and sprint behind the house. An archidon kill the other stalker behind the house, and the cat make a protective wall around the flag closest to my zone.

She keep her feat, use one stalker to contest my zone, kill a ferox rider with the not-blind rider on the right unit but can't reposition into contesting, and badly damage the archidon in her zone, but don't finish it, because she charged and only got 2 banes to charge instead of 4 with a walk. 1-1, I score my flag and she score her flag. (should have been 2-1 because I forgot that the PGBH are actually an unit for scoring purposes...)

*Turn 3* : My swordmen can charge. Marketh mortalize the right Bane Rider unit, Morghoul go on the left Bane rider unit, mortalize it, kill one, and sprint. The swordmen kill the other four rider on the left, and the full unit of ferox rider kill four more on the right. The min unit of ferox kill 4 bane warriors, the gladiator kill a contesting stalker, and the other stalker is badly damaged by the wounded archidon.. I also kill 4 bane warrior, the contesting stalker, and I badly damage the other stalker, removing cortex. I score two flag and my zone, contesting the rest. 4-1

She feat on mostly everything she still have, contest my zone by creating a bane with tartarus, kill 5 cats totals (4 on one unit, 1 in the other), and contest as she can, but she really don't have much people left. 4-2, she score her flag.

*Turn 4* : I empty my zone of the contesting bane, one flag of the contesting wraith with an extoller shot, and kill her objective with two ferox riders. 7-2, scenario win. (I had Morghoul as backup to finish the objective)

Scenario 7-2, destruction 76-10 (the rule where you don't get points if you don't finish an unit can really hose destructions points, since I had three units reduced to a single man)

Solo Master, round 2 - Morghoul 2 vs Skarre 1 - Invasion
========================================================

Another Skarre 1 ! The other list is Ghost Fleet, and Morghoul RFP with most of the list, so he really, really, really don't want to drop Ghost Fleet. It's sort of bad news because Skarre 1 is still an exhausting match up, since if you forget anything you die.

[Theme] Dark Host

* (Skarre 1) Pirate Queen Skarre [+28]
    - Stalker [8]
    - Stalker [8]
    - Stalker [8]
    - Stalker [8]
    - Stalker [8]
    - Skarlock Thrall [0(4)]
* Bane Lord Tartarus [0(6)]

* Soul Trapper [1]
* Bane Knights (min) [9]
* Bane Knights (min) [9]
* Bane Warriors (max) [16]
    - Bane Warrior Officer & Standard [5]
* Cephalyx Overlords [8]
* Wraith Engine [15]

I find that version weaker overall, but it's still skarre and the fundamental are here. Just, I think the knights don't do anything useful.

I get the turn 1, again. There is a central forest, who is ideal for me, and that's regardless of the table side, so no hesitation.

*Turn 1* : I run with everything, respecting his threat range, like the game before.

He make 4 of his stalker run backward to not be threatened by my list, and make the bane run in front. One of the stalker go in the left zone, behind a cloud but within charge range of the archidon.

*Turn 2* : My opponent did not think I would make my caster charge. Oh boy he was wrong. My find a nice spot to blind almost all the banes, the BE, and the stalker contesting the other zone, go here, kill two bane, and sprint. Then the cats kill half a dozen not-blind banes on the right side, and an archidon with Guidance and Rush kill the blinded stalker, but he wasn't able to sprint away, sadly, which was unfortunate. The gladiator is just behind it anyway.

My opponent feat on his stalkers, Tartarus, the objective, her caster, the BE, and then kill 5 cats with 2 stalker, creating a machine wraith (the BE moved in, then the stalker killed a cat), and one archidon die to a stalker.

*Turn 3* : I make the surviving cat charging one of the two stalker in the right zone. I fail to do real damage, which is unfortunate. My caster charge the other one, blind the BE with his off hand weapon, kill the stalker and really badly damage his BE. I shoot one time with an extoller the BE, but put guidance on the archidon instead of making another shot to finish it ! that mean the BE live, even if blind. The swordmen advance through the cloud (Push to the limit really helped here) and killed a dozen bane in total. The guidance archidon, instead of trying to finish the BE, kill some more bane to be sure to be able to sprint away. Lastly, the Gladiator kill the stalker who killed my Archidon, meaning my archidon traded for two stalkers in total.

He respond by killing most of the swordmen with the surviving banes, some sprays, and assorted solo attacks. On the other zone, he successfully empty the zone of its two cats and tyrant commander by doing all the 6+ and 7+ he need, which is unfortunate. 0-1. His BE run back out of Morghoul range to not die.

*Turn 4* : An extoller finish the BE, because thoses shots hit *hard*. Morghoul kill another stalker, leaving Skarre with only one left. The last cat and two last swordmen empty the left zone, I contest the right zone and badly damage the last stalker with blasts from Marketh. My last archidon kill his objective and the bane contesting the zone. 3-1.

My opponent empty the right zone again, contest as he can, but he cannot contest the left zone anymore. 4-2.

*Turn 5* : Morghoul kill the last stalker, contest his zone with a paingiver. 5-2. My opponent have 6 second left, he can't even contest anything on his turn and lose on scenario.

Solo Master, round 3 - Zaadesh 2 vs Bradigus - Recon II
=======================================================

Well, at 2-0 it's probably not surprising to see mostly A-tier list. Still, the solo master of last year felt a lot less stacked with super meta list. He play Bradigus and Krueger 2 ; since I have the Hydra, I think he won't try Krueger, who really hate seeing a pathfinder colossal he can't control. And indeed, he play Bradigus.

[Theme] The Bones of Orboros

* (Thorle 1) Bradigus Thorle the Runecarver [+27]
    - Wold Guardian [16]
    - Wold Guardian [16]
    - Woldwarden [14]
    - Wold Wight [5]
    - Wold Wight [5]

* Swamp Gobber Chef [1]
* Sentry Stone & Mannikins [5]

* Shifting Stones [3]
* Shifting Stones [3]

Against Bradigus, I would really prefer to have two battle engine. It's compensated by the fact that it's much weaker againt Krueger. Even better, I wish I had 5 titans. As for the Bradigus list itself, it's the kind who is problematic because it have three heavies ; the light aren't much of a threat, but with synergy 3 the heavies can kill everything.

He win the roll and decide to start (that's painful for me, because Bradigus is very very fast). I choose the side where I could never need pathfinder on my beast. It don't make much of a difference, but it's that.

*Turn 1* : he run with everything, having his light basically midway of the table. With them, he threat far enough that I fear for my caster. He forego teleporting his heavies in favor of advancing his stone more.

I put my beast juste out of reach of his heavies, and my caster just out of reach of everything, but his 6 lights can all go on my frontline.

*Turn 2* : he take the bait. He feat, send his 6 light into my hydra and my sentry, and do very light since they aren't strong enough for the job ; the three watcher are at POW 18 with 3 attacks, so minus 5.

I counter-feat, make Zaadesh charge a wight and cleaving a watcher, and kill them both with seriously good rolls, and sprint back to safety. The archidon successfully kill a second watcher in three attack, and sprint away to leave a path for the hydra to kill a guardian (POW 22 so the guardian did not have much of a chance). The hydra is even within 4" of the flag ! On the other side, Orin boost his chain lightning to remove a bunch of jamming mannikins, boosting the two more important damage roll to not leave anything to chance. The Rhinodon can then go in the zone, kill a wight, and severely damage a watcher. The sentry then kill the watcher and wight remaining, but can't go on the second Guardian. Still, I remove all six light and an heavy, so the game is won as long as I don't lose on assassination.

*Turn 3* : he look for an assassination attempt, as expected, but don't find one, my caster is too far, and have two beasts to sacrifical pawn on. He apply both heavies to the sentry, who die, and use a bunch of mannikins and stone to contest.

The rhinodon badly damage the warden, my gladiator transform the last guardian into a piece of modern art, but can't finish in the zone, meaning he can empty the zone reasonably. The Hydra, however, empty her zone and kill the gobber chef on the flag for good measure. 1-0

*Turn 4* : he look for an assassination attempt again, especially since I am outside of sac pawn range (well, there is an agonizer but that's all), but don't find one, because of the various counter charge. Instead of trying, he use his casters and some sprays to kill the Rhinodon, then cast Rift to kill a contesting agonizer, then use his warden to kill a contesting Krea. He contest the other zone with a mannikin and the sentry stone. 1-1

My caster kill the sentry stone on the hydra zone, then the gladiator finish the warden, and the hydra kill the other sentry stone. She also have sprayed some shifting stone and killed one stoneshaper. 2-1

*Turn 5* : he look for an assassination attempt, but don't find one, since I am back in sac pawn range of the hydra and he can't charge my caster directly. His caster charge my objective and kill it. He can't contest the Hydra zone anymore, since at that point he have two solo and two stone remaining. 3-2

Now, I could assassinate Bradigus, but scenario is safer ; I "only" need to score 4 points. My gladiator kill the rest of his army, scoring 1 in that zone. Orin run on the flag, scoring a second point here (his caster is nearly on the flag, but warlocks don't contest). My archidon is in the other zone, score a third point here. Seeing that, my hydra go on the objective, kill it (it do 18 damage in the worse case scenario ...), ensuring the victory. I then prompty forgot to make my caster run on the other flag for a fifth point ... Still, 7-2 victory, and 111 destruction points since I left only his caster.

7-2, 111-40

It's the end of day one, and I am top seed. That's good news ; winning the whole tournament seem doable at that point. I entertain myself the idea that maybe I will get something a bit original, before learning it will be the Haley 2 / Haley 3 pairing that won against the other french in the solo.

Solo Master, round 4 - Zaadesh 2 vs Haley 2 - The Pit II
========================================================

[Theme] Heavy Metal

* (Haley 2) Major Victoria Haley [+25]
    - Centurion [17]
    - Stormclad [18]
    - Thorn [13]
    - Squire [0(5)]
* Captain Arlan Strangewayes [0(4)]
* Journeyman Warcaster [0(4)]
 - Charger [9]
* Lieutenant Allison Jakes [4]
 - Stormclad [18]
* Field Mechaniks (min) [3]
* Storm Strider [18]

He have Haley 2 and Haley 3, and rather logically take Haley 2 since Haley 3 would likely run into serious armor breaking problem. Haley 2 is a somewhat decent match for Zaadesh, made *much* easier by the hydra, since she can't TK it, and probably can't kill it at all. His list seem a bit too top-heavy to boot ; stormclad are cool and all, but it's much easier to deal with two stormclads than three ironclads.

He get the first turn. I choose the side that will less cause trouble, and forget that something is a house and not a hill. *sigh*.

*Turn 1* : he run with everything ; I run, with the exception of the hydra who walk just outside the threat range of the two stormclad and put up animus.

*Turn 2* : He forgot the Hydra animus and miss his shot on my Krea with the BE ; on the other side, he TK the sentry, send the centurion into the sentry, get counter charged by the rhinodon, and discover that Hyper aggressive allow my sentry to look at his centurion. He nonetheless feat.

I feat, forgot to heal the spirit of my Sentry (*sight*), and begin to work on the Centurion with my two heavies, but with Arcane Shield and the spirit off the sentry, he survive even if he is quite damaged. The hydra position itself a bit.

*Turn 3* : Thorn, the Centurion, and the Charger finish the sentry. On the other side, the stormclad pointedly avoid to try to kill the hydra, and try to kill the archidon and gladiator. He fail on both side.

I don't have my feat anymore, and the eleap have killed all but one paingiver, so the centurion is here to stay. He get banged up again by the rhinodon, but don't quite die ; he just lose his main weapon and movement. The hydra boost her attack on the Stormclad under Allison and while not killing it, he isn't in a great shape at all, having lost its cortex and shield. The archidon and Gladiator work on the other Stormclad, who die.

*Turn 4* : Thorn, the Centurion, and the charger kill the Rhinodon at great pain, unlocking scoring on that side. The BE try to kill my contester on the zone, but leave both my objective and an agonizer alive. He try to make Alison charge through a wall to kill thoses two, but I remind him that she don't have pathfinder. She then use her speed 7 to get to the agonizer and kill it. (and, no, she isn't speed 7, it's an honest error from my opponent, I should have double checked. That would only have cost her one more focus anyway). 1-0

My Gladiator finish the job on his centurion (AT LONG LAST), but can be TK out of the zone. Then my archidon rough up the stormclad, who survive, and the hydra finish it, putting then 2 attacks into the battle engine. My caster is way back, within 1" of both the hydra and Archidon.

*Turn 5* : my opponent see a possible assassination plan, who require to TK an archidon out of a trench, then my caster out of a trench, then charging with Thorn for 4 attacks on a caster who camp 2. The plan fail at the first step, so he just finish the objective with its BE and TK my gladiator out of the zone. 3-0.

My hydra make 5 attacks on the BE, making double-6 then double-1 damage, then three unnoticeable damage roll. He say the BE have 2 HP remaining, which is suspicious to me (it mean that the average of the other roll was 4, so he probably forgot a damage roll or two). Still, it's easier to buy an attack and finish it than question whether he noted all the damage. I do so, and the BE die, leaving him with no scoring model within run range of that zone. The gladiator stay B2B with my caster just in case, the archidon charge the charger but I position him badly, so he can be TK out of the zone.

*Turn 6* : my opponent really need to finish the game, because I am very close to start scoring, and I am player 2. He can score 1 by TK the archidon, and try to imagine a world where with Reaction drive he make Thorn run around the hydra and in the other zone. I point out the patch of difficult terrain. He still try to TK the archidon out of the zone, but fail the 11+ needed three time in a row, and concede. 0-3

0-3, 81-40

Haley 2 is alway particulary taxing mentally to play against, and it's not helped when you have to double check the ability on your opponent model. At that point, one 4-0 will be up against a 3-1 ; if he lose, the tournament will have 5 games, else it will have 6. And of course, I get the 3-1, which mean that if I don't win SoS will probably mean out of top 3.

Solo Master, round 5 - Morghoul 2 vs Dreamer - Standoff
=======================================================

Zaadesh vs Dreamer is alway hard, because Dreamer can win on scenario on turn 7. That scenario in particular isn't one where I can lock the score, so things look bad. I decide to try Morghoul 2 and a win scenarion on turn 7, since I can force him to advance. Oh, and also he play another list, which was very soft to Morghoul 2. For once, I *did* note the player name : Paul North (sorry for the other four, I lost most of my notes :()

The plan is basically to be player 2, and have everyone score 1 on his turn in his zone. Then win on scenario point. Should be simple no ? It failed, because at turn 6 I forgot to activate the willbreaker to be able to force my gladiator for rush and slam something out of my zone. The rest of the game was basically us looking at each other, and me sending stuff to contest. I don't have enough experience on thoses tense games where you wait for an error. Plus, I misremembered Abyssal Gate as allowing him to place his beast, which didn't help. 

Another thing of note : we both forgot Mortality when resolving Sacrifice. The correct thing on thoses situation is *ALWAYS* to call a judge. Even if it do nothing for the rest of the game. Even if you don't remember the amount of damage. It's an error shared by both player (it's not just the Mortality owner's task to remember), and it's cleaner to ask for a judge.

5-7, 31-37

Final standing : 4th. I got a bit shafted on SoS because of that last round, but eh, it's probably better than pure random for the 4-1. It's the closest I have had from a clean tournament win (that didn't involve a <10 player tournament), and there's still axis of improvement on the gameplay. The list however performed admirably. I know a lot of people love to moan about how weak Skorne is, but let's be serious : the faction is largely at the level of Cryx or Cygnar or Orboros. You just have to actually use the tools the faction give.

Solo Master, bonus round - Zaadesh 2 vs Sorcha 3 - Standoff
===========================================================

While I was still a bit salty and starting to have an headaches from the mix of frustration and exhaustion, the tournament winner ask for the game that would have happened if I won. After a bit of internal deliberation, I accept ; I need training anyhow. He sport Sorcha 3 and I don't the other list, but for me it's clear he want to drop Sorcha 3. I take Zaadesh 2 because the game have less chance to turn catastrophically bad after a single error - having model who survive well help to deal with errors. Morghoul 2 probably have something to do against an army so reliant on infantry, but he also can lose everything to an alpha strike not executed well enough.

(not sure about the War Dog)

At a first glance, I think the jacks are by far the main damage dealer, so I need to deal with them quickly. The rest will be hard to kill but won't hit terribly hard.

He win the roll, I choose a side that have less pathfinder problem.

*Turn 1* : He advance with everything and put Iron Flesh on the Shocktrooper. I advance as much as I can.

*Turn 2* : He feat, using the central forest to deny LoS unto almost his entire army.

It's the pivotal turn. My hydra can trample to one kodiak, the archidon and rhinodon can walk to another one. I feat, send thoses three beast, and one kodiak die while the other is badly damaged. IIRC he losse his cortex, and my opponent's choice of Pathfinder objective mean he can't repair it at all. His shooting tried to kill the agonizer, but only one fell, and IIRC he fell to a melee attack.

*Turn 3* : He start an hard flank with the dragoon and the strike tanker to the left of the hydra. Then he launch the damaged kodiak and 2 shocktrooper into the hydra, not killing it by a long shot ; then he send the demolition corps onto the archidon and hydra, killing the archidon but not the hydra. Then the third kodiak kill my rhinodon.

The fact there is a dragoon next to my caster is a bit concerning "^^. Nonetheless, my hydra and titan cumulated kill all his demo corps, all his shocktroopers (who charged), the damaged kodiak, and remove most of the other kodiak. So much for the list being resilient ! My caster run to safety, which in retropest is probably a bad idea. Better camp 1 and dismount that dragoon.

*Turn 4* : he kill the hydra and the sentry. I concede and we stop here, so that I can go to my plane with a lot of time ; I think the long term favor him, but it could still have gone either way considering that he don't have much force left either. Also, he tried to make his caster charge my gladiator just to see what happen, which was good for a laugh but would have killed her if we continued the game since my caster could charge her with flank. (to be clear : he only did that because I expressed I was conceding the game).
That's ... interesting. The core of the list is reasonable to deal with, but the tankers and dragoon need a plan, which I don't have yet. But that don't seem horribly hard. The terrain is also pretty important in my opinion ; the central forest allowed him to extent *and* still deny LoS unto everything, which was pretty big for him. That being said, as usual for Khador, it's resilient, but it's a very far cry from an armor skew ; maybe I would be better with Morghoul ? The feat is still as horrible as ever for all thoses troopers, and Mortality mean that the shocktroopers are probably killable. Still, it's a lot of highish armor box.

I could also have played on the focus problem for Sorcha. She can't fill two heavies, use Stoke the Fire *and* upkeep anything, so maybe I should just have backed down a bit to force her focus thin and not allow her to alpha with everything. More tests will be needed, I hope they won't be in the final of a tournament '^^.

Conclusion
==========

I am pretty happy of my tournament. For thoses who aren't in the known, in France to get into a WTC team is a two-part process : first, you need to get good results in enough tournament to get into the selection tournament. Then, on the selection tournament, you need to score enough win, then being selectioned by a captain. So a good show at a tournament like that quite improve my odds, even if it's not a guarantee by any mean.

On the other hand, there exist a somewhat worrying trend of the WTC lists : they play lists that look bad, then lose with them. Makeda 2 last year, now DoA Morghoul 2 and Mordikaar. Since at least some of thoses guys probably play better than me (there is a reason why they are in the WTC after all !), there is something I don't understand somewhere. Do they try too specific counters that don't actually come up ?
