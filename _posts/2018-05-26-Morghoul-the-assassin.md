title: Morghoul, lord assassin [UNFINISHED]
---

Lord Assassin Morghoul is one of thoses casters who have been over the years both broken good and unplayably bad. The current version, thanks to the hard work of PP, is actually pretty balanced. More importantly, he is *fun* to play.

Why play a Master of War Morghoul list ?
========================================

Let's be honest : the biggest draw to Morghoul is that he is very good into Cryx. Master of War give him the one thing that he missed : a way to remove from play annoying pieces. It's a list who is very fast fast, play attrition well despite its model being easy to kill, and who have a good enough assassination game to cause trouble.

Morghoul himself
================

Lord Assassin Morghoul, like the Butcher, is a caster who do a lot of work during a game. He have three signature uses :

Spot removal
------------

Morghoul hit *hard*, and while a far cry from the Butcher, he can kill mostly any group of warrior model with ease, and he can kill heavy jacks with only a small bit of support. Coupled with access to Sprint and incorporeal, he can choose his target, kill it, and sprint to safety. Want an example ? While I don't have handy photos, here an example inspired from real facts :

Note that March from a tyrant commander work on both his normal movement (if he don't charge) and on the sprint movement ; hence why he do 11" (2" apparition, 7" movement + 2" march) to go to his target, then 9" to go behind the forest.

Spell support
-------------

The spell list of Morghoul is short but awesome :
* Mortality is of course a very strong debuff. In addition to make thing easier to kill, he also

Bullying
--------

Unlike some other feared assassins like Krueger 2 or Vayl 2, Morghoul rarely kill enemy casters. That's because in the end, avoiding him is easy : you just have to be more than 13" away. He ignore everything on the way, so you can rarely trick people into thinking they are safe. However, this also mean that you often can bully the opposing caster into a bad spot just by advancing to be too close for his comfort. 

Matchup & comparison
====================

My current Zaadesh list look like that :

[Theme] Imperial Warhost

* (Zaadesh 2) Lord Tyrant Zaadesh [+28]
    - Agonizer [0(6)]
    - Agonizer [0(6)]
    - Archidon [10]
    - Basilisk Krea [0(7)]
    - Desert Hydra [38]
    - Rhinodon [12]
    - Titan Gladiator [15]
    - Titan Sentry [15]
* Orin Midwinter, Rogue Inquisitor [5]
* Paingiver Beast Handlers (max) [7]

Orin is here to help with the control spell vulnerability (and he can benefit from her animus), while the rhinodon is here because there isn't enough point for another sentry, so I took the next best thing. Corners were cut.

Compared to the "stock" list, the biggest loss is the lack of free win against unprepared opponent. Unlike the original list, you can't realistically kill an heavy with your counter charge, or use defensive strike to knockdown a high value model. Thoses tricks tend to lose value against high skill opponents, but this list punish brain fart noticeably less well than the stock list.

On the other hand, the hydra version is more versatile. Faced with something like Exemplar Interdiction, immortal Zaal 2, or Storm of the north, you get much better odds due to the hydra being a real threat to infantry. The list is also less likely to die on scenario, since the hydra often contest two or three scoring element while being unmoveable and very hard to kill.
