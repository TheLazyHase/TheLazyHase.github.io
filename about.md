I am a french skorne player, quite dedicated to the cause of thoses animal-loving, peace-seeking, tolerant elves from the east.

### More Information

Not a WTC team player, but I try to enter one. I play in Paris, often with actual WTC players who use me as sparring partner. Sometime I even win !

Ah, also, my avatar is Etna, the heroine of the first Disgaea game. It's one of the best JRPG ever, with both an interesting story and a good combat system.

### Contact me

Not sure yet of what to put here, because I dislike unwanted contacts.
